## 🔐 Core Cybersecurity, Networking & Access Management Concepts I Understand
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability): Understanding how security controls protect data from unauthorized access, modification, and service disruption.   
- Defense in Depth: Applying layered security controls across network, system, application, and identity levels to reduce single points of failure.     
- Networking Fundamentals:  Strong understanding of TCP/IP, the OSI model, packet flow, ports, and network communication.    
- Common Network Protocols: Familiarity with HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, DHCP, FTP, SMTP, SSH, and their associated security risks.     
- Ports, Services & Attack Surface: Understanding how exposed services increase risk and how to minimize unnecessary access.     
- Firewalls & Network Segmentation: Knowledge of firewall rules, VLANs, and segmentation to restrict lateral movement.      
- Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS): Understanding traffic monitoring, alerting, and detection methods.    
- Packet & Traffic Analysis: Ability to recognize suspicious patterns in network traffic and abnormal behavior.      
- Identity & Access Management (IAM): Understanding how users, roles, and permissions are managed to control access to systems and data.     
- Authentication vs Authorization: Knowing the difference between verifying identity and enforcing access rights.     
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Recognizing MFA as a critical control to mitigate credential compromise.     
- Least Privilege Principle: Ensuring users, applications, and services have only the permissions necessary to perform tasks.    
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Understanding how roles simplify permission management and reduce misconfigurations.    
- Credential Security: Awareness of password policies, hashing, secure storage, and protection against brute-force attacks.    
- Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment: Identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and impact to prioritize security measures.    
- Common Attack Vectors: Understanding attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, brute force, MITM, and privilege escalation.    
- Secure Coding Practices: Emphasizing input validation, access checks, and secure error handling.    
- Cryptography Fundamentals: Understanding hashing, encryption, digital signatures, key exchange, and secure communication.    
- Incident Response Lifecycle: Familiarity with detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.     
- Logging & Monitoring: Recognizing the importance of logs and alerts in detecting unauthorized access and incidents.    
- Legal & Ethical Considerations: Awareness of privacy, compliance, and responsible security research.
